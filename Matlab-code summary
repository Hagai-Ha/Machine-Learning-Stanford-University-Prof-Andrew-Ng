Week 2:
Linear regression

Hypothesis function:
h(X, theta) = X * theta

Cost function:
J(theta) = J = ((h-y)'*(h-y))/(2*m)

Normal Equation:    (more efficient than Gradient Descent if the number of features is n<10,000)
Î¸=pinv(X'X)X'y

Week 3:
Logistic regression (sigmoid function)

Hypothesis function:
h(X, theta) = 1 / ( 1 + e^(-theta' * X)  )
