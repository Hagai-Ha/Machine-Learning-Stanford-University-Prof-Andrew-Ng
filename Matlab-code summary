Week 2:
Linear regression

Hypothesis function:
h(X, theta) = X * theta

Cost function:
J(theta) = J = ((h-y)'*(h-y))/(2*m)

Gradient Descent:
theta = theta - (alpha/m) * X' * (h - y)

Normal Equation:    (more efficient than Gradient Descent if the number of features is n<10,000)
Î¸=pinv(X'X)X'y

Week 3:
Logistic regression (sigmoid function)

Hypothesis function:
h(X, theta) = 1 / ( 1 + e^(-theta' * X)  )

Decision boundary:
theta' * X = 0
y = 1 if theta' * X >= 0
y = 0 if theta' * X < 0

Cost function:
J = (1/m) * sum(Cost(h,y))
if y = 1 --> Cost = -log(h)
if y = 0 --> Cost = -log(1-h)
